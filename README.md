# telecomunication-services-calculator

The app is a simple calculator built using React + Vite. The ProductContainer component serves as the starting point of the data flow. 
Remote or mocked data is used to hydrate the shared state located in the ProductContext. 
The core business logic is located in `src/services/Product`. 
The view consists of two product lists: one for adding products and another for displaying the summary list.
